It was founded on March 7, 1916, in Munich, Germany. At first, BMW didnât make carsâit built airplane engines during World War I.</p>\n        <p>After the war, Germany was not allowed to make planes, so BMW had to stop making engines for airplanes. The company then started making things like brakes, farm tools, and later, motorcycles. This big change helped them survive tough times.</p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>ðµ BMW and Motorcycles</h2>\n        <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/BMW_R32_%281923%29_%2834926156953%29.jpg\" alt=\"BMW Motorcycle\" class=\"image\">\n        <p>In 1923, BMW made its first motorcycle called the <strong>BMW R32</strong>. It had a cool engine called a âboxer engineâ that was powerful and easy to fix. This made BMW motorcycles super popular, and they are still popular today!</p>\n        <p>BMW bikes are used by police in many countries. They are known for being safe, fast, and comfy to ride for long trips. Some of their most famous bikes today are the <strong>BMW GS</strong> series used for adventures across mountains and deserts!</p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>ð BMW's First Cars</h2>\n        <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/BMW_3_15_PSA_frontleft_2008-05-11.jpg\" alt=\"First BMW Car\" class=\"image\">\n        <p>BMW began building cars in 1928 when it bought a car company called Dixi. Their first car was the <strong>Dixi 3/15</strong>. It was small but very important. People liked it because it was cheap and useful.</p>\n        <p>In the 1930s, BMW made the <strong>BMW 328</strong>, a cool race car that won many races. It helped BMW become famous for making fast and fun cars. People started saying BMW was the \"Ultimate Driving Machine!\"</p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>ð£ World War II</h2>\n        <p>During World War II, BMW had to go back to building airplane engines again for the German army. They also made motorcycles and trucks for soldiers. Sadly, many workers were forced to work in factories.</p>\n        <p>After the war, BMW was badly damaged. The company almost disappeared. But the workers and leaders didnât give upâthey started again by making bicycles, pots, and pans until they could make motorcycles and cars again.</p>\n      </section>\n\n      <section>\n        <h2>ð BMW in the 1950sâ1970s</h2>\n        <p>In the 1950s, BMW made cute little cars like the <strong>BMW Isetta</strong>, which looked like a tiny bubble with three wheels! It was great for city driving and saving gas.</p>\n        <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, BMW became really cool. They made sporty and stylish cars that people loved to drive.

The capital city is <strong>Tirana</strong>.</p>\n          <p class=\"muted\">Area: about 28,748 kmÂ² (a small country but with big mountains and a long coastline).</p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <h3>Population & people</h3>\n          <p>About 2.7â2.8 million people live in Albania.

In the mountains it gets cold in winter and can snow a lot. The country enjoys many sunny days â great for summer holidays and hiking in spring and autumn.</p>\n\n      <h3>Landscape & nature</h3>\n      <p>Albania is very varied: long beaches and small islands on the coast, flat plains used for farming in the middle, and high mountains in the north and east (the Accursed Mountains and Mount Korab). Rivers such as the Drin and VjosÃ« flow through the land and help make hydroelectric power.</p>\n      <p class=\"muted\">Landscape note: the mix of sea, mountains and rivers makes Albania great for beaches, hikes and nature spotting.</p>\n    </section>\n\n    <!-- History -->\n    <section id=\"history\" class=\"section\">\n      <h2>History â short timeline</h2>\n      <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Butrint_theatre.jpg\" alt=\"Butrint ancient ruins\">\n      <div class=\"timeline\">\n        <p><span class=\"badge\">Ancient</span> Illyrians lived here in ancient times.

It is surrounded by Montenegro, Kosovo, North Macedonia, and Greece, and it also has a long coastline along the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. Albania is famous for its beautiful mix of mountains, beaches, and historic towns, making it a hidden gem of Europe.</p>\n  <p>The purpose of this country profile is to provide an overview of Albaniaâs geography, history, people, culture, government, and economy. Many people around the world know very little about Albania, yet it has played an important role in European history and is quickly becoming a popular travel destination. By learning about Albania, we can better understand its challenges, achievements, and potential future.</p>\n  <p>This project will also highlight why Albania is worth visiting. It combines Mediterranean charm with a rich cultural heritage, delicious food, and friendly people. From its ancient ruins to its modern cities, Albania tells a story of survival, change, and hope. This profile will help showcase the beauty and importance of this unique country.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"geography\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Geography</h2>\n  <p>Albania is located in southeastern Europe, on the western side of the Balkan Peninsula. Its capital city is Tirana, which is the largest and most developed city in the country. Albania is relatively small in size, covering about 28,748 square kilometers, which is slightly smaller than Belgium. Despite its small area, it has a wide variety of landscapes, including mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, and coastlines. Some of its most famous natural landmarks include the Albanian Riviera with beaches like Ksamil, DhÃ«rmi, and SarandÃ«, as well as the dramatic peaks of the Accursed Mountains.</p>\n  <p>The climate of Albania is mostly Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Along the coastline, the weather is perfect for beach tourism, while in the mountains, winters bring heavy snowfall that makes skiing possible. This variety of climates supports different vegetation zones, from olive trees and vineyards in the lowlands to pine forests in the mountains. Albania also enjoys over 300 sunny days per year, which makes it one of Europeâs sunniest countries.</p>\n  <p>Albania is rich in natural resources and wildlife. Animals like brown bears, wolves, lynxes, and wild goats still roam in the mountains, while the rivers and lakes are home to freshwater fish. The fertile soil and water supply allow for agriculture, where farmers grow olives, grapes, citrus fruits, and wheat. The country also has deposits of oil, natural gas, coal, and minerals like copper and bauxite, which are important for its economy. This geography makes Albania both a beautiful and a resourceful nation.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"history\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>History</h2>\n  <p>Albaniaâs history stretches back thousands of years. The earliest known inhabitants were the Illyrians, who lived in the region in ancient times. Later, the Romans conquered Albania, and it became part of the Roman Empire. After the fall of Rome, Albania came under Byzantine rule and later the Ottoman Empire, which controlled the country for more than 400 years. This long Ottoman period left a big influence on Albaniaâs culture, food, and architecture.</p>\n  <p>Albania declared independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, but the 20th century was still full of challenges. The country was invaded during both World Wars, and after World War II, it fell under communist rule led by Enver Hoxha. Albania became one of the most isolated communist states in the world, with little contact with the outside. During this time, thousands of concrete bunkers were built across the country to defend against possible attacks.</p>\n  <p>In 1991, communism ended, and Albania began building a democratic system. Since then, the country has faced many struggles, including poverty and corruption, but it has made major improvements. Albania joined NATO in 2009 and has been working toward becoming a member of the European Union. Today, Albania is seen as a country with great potential and a bright future ahead.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"government\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Government</h2>\n  <p>Albania is a parliamentary republic, which means that its citizens vote for representatives who make laws and choose leaders. The President is the head of state, while the Prime Minister is the head of government and has the most political power. The Parliament of Albania is called the Kuvendi, and it is responsible for passing laws and guiding the countryâs policies.</p>\n  <p>The Albanian government has three main branches: the legislative branch (parliament), the executive branch (president, prime minister, and ministers), and the judicial branch (courts). This system is similar to other democracies, including South Africa. The constitution guarantees rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to vote.</p>\n  <p>In recent years, Albania has made progress in fighting corruption and improving fairness in its government. Leaders are working hard to bring Albania closer to the European Union, which would improve trade, travel, and development opportunities for its citizens. While challenges remain, Albaniaâs government continues to evolve and strengthen its democracy.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"economy\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Economy</h2>\n  <p>The currency of Albania is called the Lek (ALL). The economy of the country is considered developing, but it has been growing quickly in recent years. Key industries include agriculture, textiles, energy, mining, and tourism. Farming plays an important role, with olives, grapes, wheat, citrus fruits, and corn being the most important crops. Many families depend on farming for their daily lives.</p>\n  <p>Tourism is one of the fastest-growing parts of Albaniaâs economy. The beaches of the Albanian Riviera, the mountains of Valbona and Theth, and UNESCO World Heritage towns like Berat and GjirokastÃ«r attract more visitors every year. Albania is often called one of Europeâs best hidden treasures because of its affordability and natural beauty. Tourism brings money into the economy and helps small businesses grow.</p>\n  <p>Another important part of the Albanian economy is mining. The country has natural resources such as chromium, copper, and petroleum. These resources help Albania trade with other countries. In terms of money value, 1 Albanian Lek is worth about 0.20 South African Rand. Even though the economy still faces challenges, Albania is moving toward a stronger and more stable future.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"visit\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Why Visit Albania?</h2>\n  <p>Albania is one of Europeâs most underrated travel destinations. Visitors can enjoy the Albanian Riviera, which has some of the clearest and most beautiful beaches in the Mediterranean. Towns like Ksamil, DhÃ«rmi, and SarandÃ« offer white sandy beaches, turquoise waters, and lively summer atmospheres. For those who enjoy hiking and nature, the Accursed Mountains and Valbona Valley provide dramatic scenery and unique wildlife experiences.</p>\n  <p>The country is also full of history and culture. UNESCO sites like Berat, with its âcity of a thousand windows,â and GjirokastÃ«r, with its stone houses and castle, showcase Albaniaâs rich past. Butrint, another UNESCO site, contains ancient Greek and Roman ruins that tell stories of thousands of years. Albaniaâs cities like Tirana combine colorful modern life with traces of its communist history, making it an exciting place to explore.</p>\n  <p>Travelers also love Albania because of its friendly people and delicious food. The cuisine combines Mediterranean flavors with Balkan traditions, including dishes like byrek (savory pastry), grilled meats, and fresh seafood. The best time to visit Albania is between May and September, when festivals like Summer Day and the Tirana International Film Festival take place. With so many options, Albania has something for every type of traveler.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"funfacts\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Albania has more bunkers per square km than any other country (~170,000). These were built during communist times for protection against possible invasions.</li>\n    <li>Head gestures in Albania are opposite from many other countries: nodding means âNoâ while shaking your head means âYesâ.</li>\n    <li>The country enjoys over 300 sunny days each year, making it one of Europeâs sunniest destinations.</li>\n    <li>The Albanian language is one of the oldest and most unique languages in Europe. It is not closely related to any other modern language.</li>\n    <li>The national symbol is the black double-headed eagle, which represents bravery and freedom. It is proudly shown on the national flag.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n<footer>\n  <p>Made with â¤ï¸ | Albania Country Profile | Group Members: Aiden, Nolo, Ben, Lerato</p>\n</footer>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",

It borders Montenegro to the northwest, Kosovo to the northeast, North Macedonia to the east, and Greece to the south. Its capital city is Tirana. Albania has coastlines on both the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea.</p>\n  <p><b>Population:</b> About 3 million people.<br>\n     <b>Language:</b> Albanian (two main dialects: Gheg and Tosk).<br>\n     <b>National Flag:</b> Red with a black double-headed eagle.<br>\n     <b>National Animal:</b> Golden Eagle.</p>\n  <p><b>Climate:</b> Albania has a Mediterranean climate. Summers are hot and dry, while winters are mild and wet. Mountain areas get snow in winter, while coastal regions are sunny and warm.

The Illyrians were the first known inhabitants, followed by Greeks and Romans. Butrint, a UNESCO site, still shows ruins from those times. Later, Albania was ruled by the Byzantine Empire and then the Ottoman Empire for nearly 500 years.</p>\n  <p>In 1912, Albania declared independence from the Ottomans. The 20th century brought wars, occupation, and a communist dictatorship under Enver Hoxha. During this time, thousands of bunkers were built across the country. In 1991, Albania became a democracy. Today, it is growing and aims to join the European Union.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"government\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Government</h2>\n  <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Tirana_-_Albanian_Parliament_building.jpg\" alt=\"Albanian Parliament\">\n  <p>Albania is a parliamentary republic. Citizens elect representatives to the Kuvendi (Parliament). The President is the head of state, while the Prime Minister is the head of government and holds most power. Albaniaâs government is divided into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. Its constitution protects rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and voting rights.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"financial\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Financial and Economy</h2>\n  <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Saranda_beach.jpg\" alt=\"Tourism in Albania\">\n  <p>The currency of Albania is the Lek (ALL). One Lek is worth about 0.20 South African Rand. Albaniaâs economy is developing and has been growing quickly. Major industries include agriculture, textiles, energy, mining, and tourism.</p>\n  <p>Agriculture is vital, producing olives, grapes, citrus fruits, and corn. Tourism is booming, with visitors attracted to beaches, mountains, and cultural landmarks. Albania also exports natural resources such as chromium, copper, and petroleum.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"resources\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Natural Resources</h2>\n  <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Chromite_ore.jpg\" alt=\"Chromite mineral\">\n  <p>Albania is rich in minerals. It has deposits of chromium, copper, iron, coal, and petroleum. Albania is one of Europeâs leading producers of chromium. Rivers also provide hydropower, which supplies most of the countryâs electricity. Fertile land supports agriculture, with olives and grapes being especially important.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"animals\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Animals of Albania</h2>\n  <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Golden_eagle_in_flight_-_5.jpg\" alt=\"Golden Eagle\">\n  <p>Albania has diverse wildlife because of its mix of mountains, rivers, and forests. Animals include brown bears, wolves, lynxes, wild boars, and deer. Along the coast, dolphins and sea turtles can be found. The <b>national animal is the Golden Eagle</b>, a symbol of freedom and bravery. It appears proudly on Albaniaâs flag.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"visit\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Why Visit Albania?</h2>\n  <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Ksamil_beach%2C_Albania.jpg\" alt=\"Ksamil Beach Albania\">\n  <p>Albania is one of Europeâs most underrated travel destinations. Visitors can enjoy the Albanian Riviera, which has some of the clearest and most beautiful beaches in the Mediterranean. Towns like Ksamil, DhÃ«rmi, and SarandÃ« offer white sandy beaches, turquoise waters, and lively summer atmospheres. For those who enjoy hiking and nature, the Accursed Mountains and Valbona Valley provide dramatic scenery and unique wildlife experiences.</p>\n  <p>The country is also full of history and culture. UNESCO sites like Berat, with its âcity of a thousand windows,â and GjirokastÃ«r, with its stone houses and castle, showcase Albaniaâs rich past. Butrint, another UNESCO site, contains ancient Greek and Roman ruins that tell stories of thousands of years. Albaniaâs cities like Tirana combine colorful modern life with traces of its communist history, making it an exciting place to explore.</p>\n  <p>Travelers also love Albania because of its friendly people and delicious food. The cuisine combines Mediterranean flavors with Balkan traditions, including dishes like byrek (savory pastry), grilled meats, and fresh seafood. The best time to visit Albania is between May and September, when festivals like Summer Day and the Tirana International Film Festival take place. With so many options, Albania has something for every type of traveler.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"funfacts\" class=\"section\">\n  <h2>Fun Facts</h2>\n  <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Flag_of_Albania.svg\" alt=\"Albanian Flag\">\n  <ul>\n    <li>Albania has more bunkers per square km than any other country (~170,000).</li>\n    <li>Head gestures in Albania are opposite from many countries: nodding means âNoâ while shaking your head means âYesâ.</li>\n    <li>The country enjoys over 300 sunny days each year.</li>\n    <li>The Albanian language is one of the oldest in Europe and not closely related to any other.</li>\n    <li>The national symbol is the black double-headed eagle, proudly shown on the flag.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n<footer>\n  <p>Made with â¤ï¸ | Albania Country Profile | Group Members: Aiden, Nolo, Ben, Lerato</p>\n</footer>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n",
